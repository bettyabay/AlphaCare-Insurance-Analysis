**AlphaCare Insurance Analytics**

**Project Overview**
This repository contains the analytics and predictive modeling project undertaken for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS). Includes statistical analysis, A/B testing, and machine learning models to predict optimal insurance premiums and analyze risk factors. Designed to enhance marketing strategies and attract low-risk clients in South Africa. The goal is to optimize car insurance marketing strategies and identify "low-risk" customer segments to reduce premiums, attract new clients, and improve overall profitability in the South African market.

**Business Objective**
Analyze historical insurance claim data to:
Optimize marketing strategies.
Discover low-risk targets for premium reductions.
Develop data-driven insights into customer risk profiles and profitability metrics.
Build machine learning models to predict optimal premium values and assess key risk factors.

**Key Deliverables**
**Insurance Risk Analysis:**
Identify risk differences across provinces, zip codes, and demographics.
Perform A/B hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.

**Predictive Modeling:**
Linear regression models for claims predictions per zip code.

**Machine learning models** to predict optimal premium values based on:
Features related to the car.
Attributes of the owner.
Location details and other significant features.

**Feature Analysis:**
Evaluate the most influential features affecting claims and premiums.
Provide actionable recommendations to improve pricing strategies and product offerings.

**Skills Developed**
Data Engineering: Managing and processing large insurance datasets.
Predictive Analytics: Risk and claims forecasting using statistical and machine learning models.
Machine Learning Engineering: Training and evaluating models for optimal premium predictions.
A/B Testing: Formulating and testing hypotheses to derive actionable insights

**Final Report:**
